# Privateer Plugin for GitHub Repos

This wireframe is designed to quickly get your service pack repository up to speed!

Privateer's plugin architecture relies on some key elements being present at the top level
of the service pack, all of which are provided along with examle code in this repo.

Simply fork or clone this repo and start adjusting the tests to build your own service pack!

Based on the Open Source Project Security (OSPS) Baseline, here is a consolidated checklist of all rules across various categories, including descriptions of what each baseline implies to check.
